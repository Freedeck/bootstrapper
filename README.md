## ⚠️ Hey! This repository is no longer being maintained and is now deprecated

[The bootstrapper is now part of the Freedeck/app repository.](https://github.com/Freedeck/app)

you see, the reason this exists is to keep the user's experience easy  

the idea is they only download ONE .exe, not a zip and get lost in it.  

oh man
